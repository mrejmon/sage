    Return the set of all primitive infinite repetitions of the D0L system made
    from this morphism and an arbitrary axiom, from which all letters are
    accessible.

    Requires this morphism to be an endomorphism.

    A D0L system is a triplet `(A, \varphi, w)`, where `A` is an alphabet,
    `\varphi` a morphism on `A^*` and `w` a non-empty word (called axiom).
    The language of a D0L system is the set `\{\varphi^k(w) | k \in \NN\}`.

    An infinite repetition (aka an infinite periodic factor) of a D0L system is
    a non-empty word `w` such that `w^k` is a factor of a word of the language
    of the system for all positive integers `k`.

    ALGORITHM:

    The algorithm used is described in detail in [KS2015]_.

    Return morphisms `h` and `k` such that this morphism is simplifiable with

    If this morphism is non-injective, this function always succeeds, but can
    fail (raise ``ValueError``) if it is injective, even it if is simplifiable.

    Let `f: X^* \rightarrow Y^*` be a morphism. Then `f` is simplifiable with
    respect to morphisms `h: X^* \rightarrow Z^*` and `k: Z^* \rightarrow Y^*`,
    if `f = k \circ h` and `|Z| < |X|`. If also `Y \subseteq X`, then morphism
    `g: Z^* \rightarrow Z^* = h \circ k` is a simplification of `f`
    (with respect to `h` and `k`).

    Therefore a morphism is simplifiable if it contains "more letters than is
    needed". Simplification preserves some properties of the original morphism
    (e.g. repetitiveness).

    Time complexity is on average quadratic with regards to the size of the
