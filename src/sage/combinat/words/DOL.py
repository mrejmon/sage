    also infinite repetitions, therefore this method returns only the
    lexicographically smallest one from each conjugacy class.

    Return morphisms `h` and `k` such that this morphism is simplifiable with

    If this morphism is non-injective, this function always succeeds, but can
    fail (raise ``ValueError``) if it is injective, even it if is simplifiable.

    Let `f: X^* \rightarrow Y^*` be a morphism. Then `f` is simplifiable with
    respect to morphisms `h: X^* \rightarrow Z^*` and `k: Z^* \rightarrow Y^*`,
    if `f = k \circ h` and `|Z| < |X|`. If also `Y \subseteq X`, then morphism

    Therefore a morphism is simplifiable if it contains "more letters than is

    Requires this morphism to be an endomorphism.

    Basically calls :meth:`simplify` until the result is injective. If this
    morphism is already injective, instead of raising an exception a quadruplet
    `(g, h, k, i)` is still returned, where `g` and `h` are equal to this
    morphism, `k` is the identity morphism and `i` is 0.

    Let `f: X^* \rightarrow Y^*` be a morphism and `Y \subseteq X`. Then
    `g: Z^* \rightarrow Z^*` is an injective simplification of `f` with respect
    to morphisms `h: X^* \rightarrow Z^*` and `k: Z^* \rightarrow Y^*` and a
    positive integer `i`, if `g` is injective and `|Z| < |X|` and
    `g^i = h \circ k` and `f^i = k \circ h`.

    For more information see Section 4 in [KO2000]_.
